## A quick note:

* This website is my first assignment project using PHP on GitHub and on the internet for that matter.  
* I've used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL to develop the front and back end, keeping a clean modern design aesthetic in mind.  
* My work was made easier by using Bootstrap, HTML2Canvas, jsPDF and SQL input filtering.
* Use the .sql file provided in the docs folder if you wish to run the project in your own localhost server and change the PHP to MySQL connection variables in the .php files accordingly.
* Your feedback would be highly appreciated! Feel free to get in touch using the contact details on my GitHub profile.

## License?

None. Feel free to use the project files as a template for your own assignment projects (Not for the UpSkill programme of course)!
